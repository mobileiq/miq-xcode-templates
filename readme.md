# Xcode file and project templates to replace the default ones

- Clone this repository in to your user templates folder:
`git clone git@github.com:mobileiq/miq-xcode-templates.git ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates`
- When creating a new file/project you'll see a group called MIQ.  Use this for creating new files and projects

There's not much documentation that I've found on Xcode projects yet, but this blog post has some good info:
